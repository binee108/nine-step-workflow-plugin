- **Use commercially** - Deploy in production, build products, offer services
- **Modify freely** - Adapt agents, change workflow, add custom skills
- **Distribute** - Share with team, clients, or publicly
- **Sublicense** - Include in your own products or templates
- **Remove attribution** - Not required (but appreciated!)
- **Fork and build upon** - Create derived template systems

#### ⚠️ You SHOULD (Recommended but not required):

- **Contribute improvements** back to community
- **Share interesting customizations** as examples

#### 🚫 You CANNOT:

- **Hold authors liable** - Use at your own risk, no warranties

- **Claim exclusive rights** - Others can use the same templates

### What This Does NOT Cover

This license covers the **template system, agent configurations, workflow documentation, and skills**.

It does NOT cover:
- Your project code created using these templates
- Your custom agents or skills you create
- Your proprietary business logic
- Your domain-specific customizations

You retain full ownership of your work. This license only applies to the template files themselves.

### Customization and Distribution

When distributing your customized version:

**Required**: Include this license file (or equivalent MIT License notice)
**Recommended**: Note that it's based on "Claude Code Agent Template System"
**Optional**: Share your improvements with the community

### Example Attribution (Optional)

If you'd like to credit the templates (appreciated but not required), you can add:

**In Documentation**:
```markdown
This project uses the [Claude Code Agent Template System](link)
for AI-assisted development workflows. (MIT License)
```

**In README**:
```markdown
## Development Workflow

Built using Claude Code with agent templates. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for details.
```

**In Code Comments**:
```python
# Agent configuration adapted from Claude Code Agent Template System
# https://github.com/your-repo/claude-agent-templates
```

### For Commercial Products

You can absolutely use these templates in commercial products:

- SaaS platforms
- Consulting services
- Training courses
- Development tools
- Packaged products

No royalties, no fees, no permission needed.

If your commercial product **is** a template system (competing product), that's allowed too under MIT License. We'd appreciate a mention but it's not required.

### Patents

We make no patent claims. If you implement novel techniques from these templates, patent rights are yours.

### Trademark

"Claude" and "Claude Code" are trademarks of Anthropic. This license does not grant trademark rights.

You cannot imply that Anthropic endorses your project, but you can accurately describe that your project uses Claude Code CLI.

### Contributor Rights

By contributing to this template system, you agree:

- Your contributions are your original work or properly licensed
- You grant the same MIT License rights to your contributions
- You have the right to make the contribution

### Version History

**1.0.0** (2025-11-10): Initial release with MIT License

## Why MIT License?

We chose MIT License because:

1. **Maximum Freedom** - Use however you want
2. **Simple & Clear** - Easy to understand
3. **Permissive** - Compatible with most projects
4. **Industry Standard** - Widely recognized and accepted
5. **Commercial Friendly** - No restrictions on business use

## Questions?

**Can I use this in a closed-source project?**
Yes, absolutely. MIT allows proprietary use.

**Do I need to open-source my customizations?**
No. Your customizations are yours to keep private or share.

**Can I sell consulting based on these templates?**
Yes. Offer services, training, customization - all allowed.

**What if I found a bug?**
Report it! But remember "no warranty" - use at your own risk.

**Can I contribute improvements?**
Please do! Contributions welcome under same MIT terms.

**Can I create a competing template system?**
Yes, but we hope you'll contribute instead!
